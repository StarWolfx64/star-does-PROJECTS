## Controls Assessment Checklist

### Instructions:
For each control, answer "Yes" or "No" to determine if Botium Toys currently has the control in place. An explanation is provided for context to assist with completing the checklist.

| **Control**                                | **Yes** | **No** | **Explanation**                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Least Privilege                            |         |    x     | Currently, all employees have access to customer data; privileges need to be limited to reduce the risk of a breach. |
| Disaster Recovery Plans                    |         |    x     | No disaster recovery plans are in place; these are critical for ensuring business continuity.               |
| Password Policies                          |         |    x     | Employee password requirements are minimal, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to secure data.       |
| Separation of Duties                       |         |    x     | Not implemented; separation is needed to prevent fraud and limit access to critical data.                   |
| Firewall                                   |   x      |         | A firewall is in place and blocks traffic based on a defined set of security rules.                         |
| Intrusion Detection System (IDS)           |         |    x     | An IDS is needed to detect potential intrusions and suspicious activity.                                     |
| Backups                                    |         |    x     | No backups are available; critical data must be backed up to ensure continuity during incidents.             |
| Antivirus Software                         |   x      |         | Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.                               |
| Legacy System Monitoring                   |         |    x     | Legacy systems are monitored, but there is no regular schedule or clear intervention policies.              |
| Encryption                                 |         |    x     | Encryption is not currently used to protect sensitive information, such as customer payment data.            |
| Password Management System                 |         |    x     | No centralized password management system exists; implementing one would improve efficiency and security.    |
| Locks (Offices, Storefront, Warehouse)     |    x     |         | Physical locations have sufficient locks to prevent unauthorized access.                                    |
| Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)          |     x    |         | CCTV systems are installed and functioning properly at all physical locations.                              |
| Fire Detection/Prevention                  |    x     |         | Fire detection and prevention systems, such as alarms and sprinklers, are in place and operational.          |

## Recommendations

### Summary of Recommendations:
- **Implement Least Privilege and Separation of Duties**: Restrict employee access to sensitive data based on job roles.
- **Develop Disaster Recovery Plans**: Establish and test disaster recovery procedures to ensure business continuity.
- **Enhance Encryption Practices**: Encrypt sensitive data, including customer credit card information and PII, both at rest and in transit.
- **Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Implement IDS to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activity.
- **Strengthen Password Management**: Enforce robust password policies and adopt a centralized password management system.
- **Classify and Inventory Assets**: Properly classify existing assets to identify additional controls and improve security measures.

By implementing these recommendations, Botium Toys can significantly improve its security posture, reduce risks, and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.

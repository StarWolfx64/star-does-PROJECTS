# Botium Toys Internal Security Audit: Scenario Overview

## Scenario Overview

This scenario is based on a fictional company: **Botium Toys**. 

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The company operates a single physical location that serves as their main office, storefront, and warehouse for products. Recently, Botium Toys' online presence has grown, attracting customers both in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support the growing online market globally. 

The IT department manager recognizes the need for an internal IT audit to help maintain compliance and business operations as the company grows. She believes the internal audit will improve security and help identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also concerned about compliance with regulations related to processing and accepting online payments and conducting business within the European Union (E.U.).

The IT manager has decided to implement the **National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)** to guide the audit. The framework will help establish audit scope, goals, asset listings, and conduct a risk assessment. The ultimate goal is to identify risks or fines the company could face due to its current security posture.

### Key Areas of Focus:
- Internal audit scope
- Asset management
- Risk assessment
- Compliance with regulations like PCI DSS and GDPR

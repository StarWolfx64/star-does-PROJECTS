## Step 2: Conduct Risk Assessment

### **Identifying Assets**
1. **Physical Assets**:
   - **Offices, storefront, and warehouse**: These physical locations are secured with locks and CCTV surveillance.
   - **Employee Equipment**: Laptops, desktops, smartphones, remote workstations, and peripherals.
   - **Legacy Systems**: Outdated systems that require regular monitoring.
   
2. **Digital Assets**:
   - **Network infrastructure**: Routers, switches, and internal servers.
   - **Data storage**: Databases containing sensitive customer data and inventory management systems.
   - **E-commerce platform**: The online storefront, which stores and processes customer orders and payment data.

### **Identifying Risks**
1. **Inadequate Asset Management**:
   - Risk of unauthorized access to critical business data.
   - Missing classification of digital and physical assets.
   
2. **Lack of Encryption for Sensitive Data**:
   - Customer credit card information and PII are stored and transmitted in an unencrypted form, exposing data to breaches.

3. **Insufficient Access Controls**:
   - All employees have broad access to internal data, with no enforcement of **least privilege** or **separation of duties**.

4. **Non-Compliance with PCI DSS**:
   - Payment data is not properly encrypted or handled according to PCI DSS standards.
   
5. **Non-Compliance with GDPR**:
   - No clear plan for notifying customers about breaches within 72 hours, and inconsistent enforcement of privacy policies.

### **Risk Scoring**:
On a scale of 1 to 10, the current risk score is **8/10**. This indicates a high level of risk, primarily due to gaps in security controls, data protection, and non-compliance with industry regulations.

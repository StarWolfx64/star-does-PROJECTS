## About Me

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong foundation in network defense, ethical hacking, and incident response. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Phoenix, I am focused on gaining practical experience and staying up-to-date with industry trends. This repository is part of my ongoing efforts to build a comprehensive portfolio of work to showcase my skills and knowledge.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Conduct an internal security audit] 
# Botium Toys Internal Security Audit

This project involves performing an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a small business that has expanded its online presence. The audit focuses on evaluating their security posture, identifying vulnerabilities, and ensuring compliance with necessary regulations. The audit includes both technical and administrative aspects, aiming to strengthen the organization's security controls and compliance practices.

## Key Concepts Learned
- **Security Auditing**: Understanding the processes involved in conducting an internal security audit, including risk assessments, controls assessments, and compliance checks.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact business operations, and assigning risk scores to prioritize mitigation efforts.
- **Control Assessment**: Evaluating the effectiveness of administrative, technical, and physical controls within the organization to protect assets.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring the organization adheres to regulatory standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR.

## Tools Used
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Utilized to guide the audit process and structure the risk and controls assessment.
- **Risk Management Tools**: Used for evaluating and scoring the identified risks.
- **Compliance Checklists**: Applied for ensuring adherence to standards like PCI DSS and GDPR.

## Goals of the Project
- **Evaluate Security Posture**: Review the current security controls, assets, and compliance procedures.
- **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Highlight areas that need improvement in terms of physical, technical, and administrative security.
- **Mitigate Risks**: Provide recommendations for improving the security posture and reducing the overall risk to the organization.
- **Ensure Compliance**: Confirm that the organization complies with industry standards and regulations to avoid potential fines or security breaches.


## Skills Utilized

- **Security Auditing**: Conducted a comprehensive internal security audit, including risk and controls assessments, and compliance verification.
- **Risk Management**: Identified and evaluated potential risks to business continuity, including assets and regulatory compliance gaps.
- **Compliance Assessment**: Ensured adherence to industry standards such as PCI DSS and GDPR, assessing the organization's data security practices.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Analyzed current security controls and identified areas of improvement to reduce vulnerabilities in both physical and digital assets.
- **Reporting and Documentation**: Compiled audit findings and provided actionable recommendations to improve the security posture of the organization.

## Tools/Technologies Used

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Guided the risk assessment and control evaluations based on industry-standard security best practices.
- **Compliance Checklists**: Utilized pre-defined compliance checklists for PCI DSS and GDPR to assess the organization's adherence to regulatory requirements.
- **Risk Management Tools**: Tools to assess and score risks based on the likelihood and potential impact, aiding in the prioritization of mitigation efforts.
- **Firewall and IDS/IPS Tools**: Evaluated and assessed the configuration of firewalls and the need for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to identify and mitigate potential threats.
- **Encryption Standards**: Assessed encryption practices to ensure data protection in line with PCI DSS for securing sensitive customer and payment information.
- **Password Management Systems**: Analyzed the need for a centralized password management system to enforce strong authentication policies and reduce security risks.
